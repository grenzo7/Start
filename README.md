# Train_Status_Checker

## Description

This is my first ever Python Project so it'll always be one my key projects. This Train Status Checker would show the available tickets for all of the trains and allows the user to book the ticket and particular seat number as per the user choice. It would also show the status if the user-choosen train or 
seats are available or not.
